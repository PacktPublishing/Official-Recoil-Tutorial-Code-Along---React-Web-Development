Styling Code For Video 3.6 - Styling A Recoil App with CSS

Since this course is primarily designed to learn Recoil we will not write each line of styling together as that could prove redundant and time inefficient.

Instead, we will cover the key CSS core concepts for styling with Recoil including mapping out components and styling containers and use this imported library as our resource to pool from.

Happy coding!
